			<p>musical potential</p>
		</header>

		<p>This is primarily a skill that is developed through exposure to music and keenly <em>listening</em>. The more you can immerse yourself with listening to music and the more musical ideas your brain can absorb, the more musical ideas you’ll be able conjure up</p>

		<p>Someone who has spent an hour a day for 50 years keenly listening to jazz music is likely to have a large jazz “vocabulary” to draw from when it comes time to create music. Even if he’s never touched an instrument in his life, all the jazz ideas he’s soaked up over the years will be deeply rooted into his brain and this means he has great potential as a jazz musician</p>

		<p>If you have all the musical creativity in the world, you have all the musical potential in the world. Listening to music and the act of practicing creating new musical ideas develops this skill</p>

		<header>
			<h1 id="technical-proficiency">Technical Proficiency</h1>
			<p>proficiency at the instrument</p>
		</header>

		<p>If you have all the musical creativity in the world, but aren’t technically proficient enough at an instrument to <em>actually play</em> them, all your amazing ideas will stay in your mind where no one can hear them (unless you employ someone else to do it, which <em>is</em> an option)</p>

		<p>All those crazy fast, complex solos and compositions require great technical prowess and command over one’s instrument. If your technical ability isn’t sufficient to play something, your fingers will be stumbling over the notes and you’ll have pauses at the wrong times because you can’t keep up. If there’s lots of really dense, complex chords in a row that you need to play, it’ll take you forever to figure out where your hands/fingers go on your instrument, so you won’t be able to play in time - and if you’re not playing in time, it’s pretty much wrong <em>by default</em></p>

		<p>So, whatever levels your musical creativity and technical proficiency are at, your <em>tangible, visible</em> musical ability will match the lowest one. If you’re highly musically creative and have an enormous vocabulary, but aren’t technically proficient enough yet to play it, your visible musical ability when you perform doesn’t get any credit for your creativity, now does it? You’ll be stuck playing simple things because your technical ability is holding you back and won’t allow for anything more complicated</p>

		<p>High creativity, low technical proficiency = low musical ability</p>

		<p>Conversely, if you’re highly technically proficient at your instrument, but have poor musical creativity, you’ll <em>still be playing simple things</em> when it comes time to sit down and play. You have high technical proficiency and could play amazingly complex things, but you don’t have the musical creativity to <em>come up with</em> any complex musical ideas, so you’re stuck playing simply.</p>

		<p>In this way, these two “pillars” (Musical Creativity and Technical Proficiency) are significant bottlenecks to your musical ability.</p>

		<h3>Technical proficiency is not enough</h3>

		<p>Have we really covered everything in just 2 “pillars”? If you have great musical ideas and great technical proficiency, that should be everything you need, right?</p>

		<p>Wrong. Your level of musical creativity provides you with the idea, and your level of technical proficiency means you have enough physical dexterity to coordinate the hand movements to execute the idea, but there’s only one problem: <em>You have no idea which sequence of keys to press, strings to pluck, buttons/valves to press (or whatever) will bring your musical idea to life</em></p>

		<p>To put it another way: Even if you can play the most complex scales and chords at 300 BPM (beats per minute), and even if you have a great musical idea, you still don’t know which sequence of notes and chords you need to play so you can <em>make the sounds that you are hearing in your head</em></p>

		<p>That may sound strange, but it’s true for music, with (sort of) one exception: the voice</p>

		<p>If you have an amazing opera song idea in your head with some super awesome parts with “really high notes” (for example), you can probably sing it. Maybe, if your technical proficiency with your “instrument” (voice) isn’t adequate, you might struggle with those high notes. Also maybe, if you’ve never sang a note in your <em>life</em>, you might struggle with <em>every note in the entire song</em>. But, if you have a creative melodic idea, and have the technical proficiency with your voice to be capable of executing the idea, you can pretty much sing it</p>

		<p>So <em>why is this not so with other instruments</em>? It’s sort of simple: for vocals, your brain <em>directly</em> controls the pitch of your voice. For an instrument, you have to <em>operate an external system</em> to get the sounds out of it. This “external system” (instrument) was built (systematically) to provide an operable structure that produces sounds, and you have to understand the sounds you’re hearing in your mind at a much “higher level of consciousness/cognition” to be able to understand/deduce which notes to play to get those sounds out of the instrument</p>

		<p>What I mean is that (assuming adequate technical proficiency):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For operating the voice, you hear a melody in your mind, and you mimick that melody (sort of subconsciously). You hear the sounds, you sing the sounds, it’s that’s simple</li>
			<li>For operating basically any other instrument, when you hear a melody in your mind, you’ll have no idea which keys to press to produce those sounds without first <em>translating those sounds into notes</em>, then playing those notes</li>
		</ul>

		<p>So if I walk up to a highly technically proficient instrumentalist, I can tell him to play the notes C-E-B-F-G over and over at 300 BPM for 3 minutes and you can probably do it. If I were to, instead, go to <em>that same musician</em> and play him (from my phone) the sounds that C-E-B-F-G make, and then ask him to play it, he <em>will not be able to play those sounds from his instrument without first translating those sounds into notes</em></p>

		<p>Conversely, if I walk up to a vocalist and play him (from my phone) the sounds that C-E-B-F-G make, and then ask him to sing it, he <em>will</em> be able to sing those sounds back to me without translating anything into notes</p>

		<p>But if I walk up to <em>that same</em> vocalist and ask him to sing C-E-B-F-G, he will <em>not</em> be able to sing those notes without first converting those note names into sound for him to imitate</p>

		<p>See what’s going on here? The voice doesn’t require any knowledge of notes to work. You imagine a melody, can hear it in your mind, and you can sing those sounds because you can hear them. But instruments <em>do</em> need knowledge of notes to work. You imagine a melody, can hear it in your mind, and you need to translate those sounds into notes so you know what to do with your instrument to get those sounds out of it</p>

		<p>There are probably exceptions: people with extraordinary gifts, savants, etc. But for 99% percent of musicians, this is the only <em>trainable</em> method to acquiring the ability to play your musical ideas with an instrument</p>

		<p>So if sufficient technical proficiency isn’t enough to be able to play your musical ideas, and we need “something extra” to be able to translate sounds into notes, then what is it? That’s where the third “pillar” comes into the picture: Music Theory/Ear Training</p>

		<h3 id="music-theoryear-training-does-not-hinder-creativity">Music theory/ear training does not hinder creativity</h3>

		<p>Music theory is <em>not</em> some sort of law or something that restricts your freedom and creativity. It’s just an attempt at trying to describe what tends to make music sound good and what tends to make music sound bad. It also has the added benefit of creating terms and new language so we can communicate ideas about music more efficiently (“chord” is a lot easier to use in discussion than “multiple, sustained sound frequencies”)</p>

		<p>There is <em>nothing</em> wrong with taking an artform and trying to study what tends to work well, what tends to not work well, and figure out why that might be. Anyone might be able to just “figure these things out” over a lifetime of playing but, let’s be honest, it saves a lot of time to hear what generations and generations of people have already figured out before you so we don’t have to “reinvent the wheel”. Instead of spending your life figuring out how music works yourself, wouldn’t it be better to simply learn what people <em>already</em> know/understand about music and then spend your lifetime <em>benefitting from and using</em> a good understanding of music?</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>But X, Y, and Z were/are highly successful and famous musicians and they don’t know any music theory, why should I?</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>You might be surprised to hear that I’ve encountered many musicians who’ve claimed to have “0 music theory knowledge” yet, after chatting with them, it turns out they have plenty of it. Knowing how keys, scales and chords work (and what they sound like) is <em>foundational</em> to one’s understanding of music, and you might be surprised just how many professional musicians actually <em>do</em> know these things and that they use that knowledge constantly - they just aren’t always aware that that’s what it is</p>

		<h3 id="fine-music-theoryear-training-is-a-big-deal-and-i-need-to-understand-it-to-play-my-musical-ideas-with-an-instrument.-what-is-it">Fine, music theory/ear training is a big deal, and I need to understand it to play my musical ideas with an instrument. What is it?</h3>

		<p>Music theory is just a collection of terms, concepts and ideas that attempt to describe what tends to sound good in music and what tends to sound bad.</p>

		<p>There are 3 <em>foundational</em> concepts to understand to have mastered the basics: Keys, Scales and Chords</p>

		<p>In short:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A “Key” is a <em>collection</em> of notes that tend to sound good together</li>
			<li>A “Scale” is a <em>sequence</em> of notes (one at a time) from a key in a certain order</li>
			<li>A “Chord” is a <em>group</em> of notes from a key, multiple at a time</li>
		</ul>

		<p>That’s a longer discussion, and I’ve mapped everything out for you in my <a href="../musicTheory">Fundamentals of Music Theory</a> article</p>
