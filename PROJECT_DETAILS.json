Bash, pandoc, sed were used as a 'bootstrap' process to do the original conversion of the content from Markdown to HTML - sed supplies some automated details injection. jQuery handles the mobile version of the navigation menu. The quiz applications in the website are listed as separate projects. Regarding lines of code, I only counted 200 LOC for the HTML file of each informational webpage, then the CSS/JS for one webpage - also, I did not include the quiz applications as they are listed as separate projects due to their size",
