## General {.centered .bordered}
* Our Western system of music has 12 unique notes

~~~
	1: C
	2: C#/Db
	3: D
	4: D#/Eb
	5: E
	6: F
	7: F#/Gb
	8: G
	9: G#/Ab
	10: A
	11: A#/Bb
	12: B
~~~

	- That's it. So, if you walk up to a piano and see 88 keys, what you'll find is that the entire bed of piano keys is just a sequence of these 12 different notes repeated over and over from the bottom to the top in this order
* The reason that notes 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11 have "two different names" isn't really important right now, but you can read about it here later:
	- [Enharmonic Notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic)
* A key is a collection of 7 notes that tend to sound good together
* There are 12 keys
* The notes of each of the 12 keys can be "derived" by applying a pattern to each of the starting notes. You can read more in the [Intervals - Scale/Chord Qualities](#intervals-scale-chord-qualities) section below

## Modes/Scales {.centered .bordered}
* Each key is a collection of 7 unique notes

~~~
	Ex: "The key of C" has these 7 unique notes:
		C, D, E, F, G, A, B
~~~

* If I mix those notes around in any way, I'm still describing the notes which make up the identity of "the key of C"

~~~
	Ex:
	Original: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
	Moving the first note to the end: D, E, F, G, A, B, C
	Scrambling them randomly: F, C, E, A, G, B, D
	etc.
~~~

* If we sort the notes of a key into a certain order, then change the sequence of notes by repeatedly moving the first note to the end, we get 7 unique scales
~~~
	Ex:
	If these are the notes of C (in no particular order):
		F, C, E, A, G, B, D
	Then we first need to sort them into this form (sort of alphabetical):
		C, D, E, F, G, A, B
	And then repeatedly shift the first note to the last position, and take a snapshot after each iteration, we get this:
		1 (Original): C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		2: D, E, F, G, A, B, C

		3: E, F, G, A, B, C, D

		4: F, G, A, B, C, D, E

		5: G, A, B, C, D, E, F

		6: A, B, C, D, E, F, G

		7: B, C, D, E, F, G, A

		8: C, D, E, F, G, A, B
~~~
	- You'll notice that iterations 1 and 8 are identical, so iterations 1-7 (inclusive) provide *unique sequences* (scales) utilizing the 7 unique notes of the key
* Those 7 unique scales are known as "the *modes* of the key", and they have special names, named after their starting note

~~~
	Ex: Here are the 7 "modes" of the key of C
		Original, sorted version: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		"Mode 1 of the key of C":
		= "C Ionian": C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		"Mode 2 of the key of C":
		= "D Dorian": D, E, F, G, A, B, C

		"Mode 3 of the key of C"
		= "E Phrygian": E, F, G, A, B, C, D

		"Mode 4 of the key of C"
		= "F Lydian": F, G, A, B, C, D, E

		"Mode 5 of the key of C"
		= "G Mixolydian": G, A, B, C, D, E, F

		"Mode 6 of the key of C"
		= "A Aeolian": A, B, C, D, E, F, G

		"Mode 7 of the key of C"
		= "B Locrian": B, C, D, E, F, G, A
~~~

* The 1st and 6th modes are extra special and have nicknames: Major and Minor, respectively. These are the most commonly used scales in Western music

~~~
	Ex:
		Original, sorted version: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		Mode 1 - C Ionian: C, D, E, F, G, A, B (aka "C Major")
		Mode 6 - A Aeolian: A, B, C, D, E, F, G (aka "A Minor")

~~~
	- For the key of C, one can *colloquially* say that "C Major" is "the major scale of the key of C", and that "A Minor" is "the minor scale of the key of C"
	- It is for this reason that the scale of A minor is referred to as the "relative minor (scale)" of the key of C. Whereas the scale of C minor is referred to as the "parallel minor (scale)" of the key of C

* Confusing: Though there are two *special* scales with "Major" and "Minor" in their nicknames, there are actually 3 total major modes and 4 minor modes

~~~
	Ex: Here are the 7 "modes" of the key of C with
		their "major" and "minor" designations:

		Original, sorted version: C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		"Mode 1 of the key of C":
		= "C Ionian": Major

		"Mode 2 of the key of C":
		= "D Dorian": Minor

		"Mode 3 of the key of C"
		= "E Phrygian": Minor

		"Mode 4 of the key of C"
		= "F Lydian": Major

		"Mode 5 of the key of C"
		= "G Mixolydian": Major

		"Mode 6 of the key of C"
		= "A Aeolian": Minor

		"Mode 7 of the key of C"
		= "B Locrian": Minor
~~~

	- As you can see, Modes 1, 4 and 5 are major, and Modes 2, 3, 6 and 7 are minor
	- After reading the next section, you'll notice the pattern applies there too (though, you'll notice that #7 is different there)
	- The reason these different scales are considered major and minor is covered in the [Intervals - Scale/Chord Qualities](#intervals-scale-chord-qualities) section below


## Chords/The NNS (Nashville Number System)	{.centered .bordered}
* On any particular scale, we can refer to their particular notes as "scale degrees"

~~~
	Ex: The scale degrees of the scale: "C Major"
		(Original, sorted version: C, D, E, F, G, A, B)

		"Scale degree #1": C
		"Scale degree #2": D
		"Scale degree #3": E
		"Scale degree #4": F
		"Scale degree #5": G
		"Scale degree #6": A
		"Scale degree #7": B
~~~

* The simplest type of chord is typically acknowledged to contain 3 notes, and is referred to as a "triad"
* Triads are constructed by choosing a note in a scale, and adding 2 more notes to it by going up the scale and skipping a note each time
~~~
	Ex: Triads are constructed like this:
		The scale of C Major repeated twice:
			1  2  3  4  5  6  7  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
			C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B

				  1   2   3   4   5   6  7  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
		Triad 1: (C), D, (E), F, (G), A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		Triad 2: C, (D), E, (F), G, (A), B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		Triad 3: C, D, (E), F, (G), A, (B), C, D, E, F, G, A, B

		Triad 4: C, D, E, (F), G, (A), B, (C), D, E, F, G, A, B

		Triad 5: C, D, E, F, (G), A, (B), C, (D), E, F, G, A, B

		Triad 6: C, D, E, F, G, (A), B, (C), D, (E), F, G, A, B

		Triad 7: C, D, E, F, G, A, (B), C, (D), E, (F), G, A, B


		*Notice*: Triad 1 is a triad built on the first scale degree,
					Triad 2 is a triad built on the second scale degree,
					etc.
~~~

* For reasons that don't matter right now, triads 1, 4 and 5 are referred to as "Major Triads" and triads 2, 4, and 6 are referred to as "Minor Triads", and triad 7 is referred to as a "Diminished Triad"
	- If you're curious, you can read more below in the [Intervals - Scale/Chord Qualities](#intervals-scale-chord-qualities) section
* The words "Major", "Minor" and "Diminished" are referred to as "Chord Qualities", which attempt to describe the general qualities of how a chord sounds
	- Major tends to be "brighter" overall
	- Minor tends to be "darker" overall
	- Diminished tends to be kind of "dark and tense"
* The 7 triads of a scale can be referred to with roman numerals (a notation used in the Nashville Number System), like this:

~~~
	1 2  3   4  5 6  7
	I ii iii IV V vi viiÂ°
~~~

	- Where capital letters imply that the chord is Major, and lowercase letters imply that the chord is Minor. Then the lowercase letters and degree symbol mean the chord is Diminished

Chord Progressions
* Western music is made up of 3 fundamental ideas
	- Melody
	- Harmony
	- Rhythm
* The "Harmony" part of music implies that chords are used
* The usage of chords in music typically involves a repeating sequence, known as a "Chord Progression"

~~~
	Ex: (Using the NNS notation)

	Chord Progression #1: 1-5-6-4 = I-V-vi-IV

	Chord Progression #2: 1-4-6-5 = I-IV-vi-V

	Chord Progression #3: 4-1-6-5 = IV-I-vi-V

	Chord Progression #4: 4-6-1-5 = IV-vi-I-V

	Chord Progression #5: 6-4-1-5 = vi-IV-I-V
~~~
* These chord progressions are commonly used today in contemporary music genres, such as rock, pop, country and metal
* How the harmony and melody of a song interact is hugely important to how the music sounds
* If a IV chord (contains scale degrees 4-6-1) is being played for the harmony and the melody is playing scale degree **4**, the note will "feel at rest"
	- This is because the melody's scale degree 4 sort of "slots into" the first note of the harmony's IV chord (which is also scale degree 4) and this produces a stable sound
* If a IV chord (contains scale degrees 4-6-1) is being played for the harmony and the melody is playing scale degree **6**, the note also will "feel at rest"
	- This is because the melody's scale degree 6 sort of "slots into" the second note of the harmony's IV chord (which is also scale degree 6) and this produces a stable sound
* If a I chord (contains scale degrees 1-3-5) is being played for the harmony and the melody is playing scale degree 4, the note will "feel unstable"
	- This is because the melody's scale degree 4 has no harmony notes to "slot into". The harmony note which is the closest to the melody note is the second note of the harmony's I chord (scale degree 3)*. Because the melody note is closest to the second harmony note, there is a sort of "gravity" pulling the melody note to the second harmony note. This "gravity" can actually be heard, and provides a feeling of "tension" to the listener.

	Thus, if the harmony is playing a I chord, and the melody is playing scale degree 4, this produces an unstable sound

* *Why is scale degree 3 closest to scale degree 4? Why not scale degree 5?
	- This is covered in the next section [Intervals - Scale/Chord Qualities](#intervals-scale-chord-qualities) section (below)

* The reason these different scales are considered major and minor is covered in the [Intervals - Scale/Chord Qualities](#intervals-scale-chord-qualities) section below
* For reasons that don't matter right now, triads 1, 4 and 5 are referred to as "Major Triads" and triads 2, 4, and 6 are referred to as "Minor Triads", and triad 7 is referred to as a "Diminished Triad"

Talk about chord functions "dominant, mediant, submediant"


WWHWWWH

***Talk about the NNS chord qualities of scale degrees and reference that the modes follow the major/minor quality pattern too***

***Talk about how intervals make up chords and this gives them their chord qualities and influences their "color" minor has the b3, so it's darker, dim has b3 and b5 so it's even more dark, etc.
* There are also common scales of a key that use less than 7 notes, as the modes do.

What is a scale degree?




* A "Key" is a collection of 7 unique notes that tend to sound good together
* A "Scale" is a sequence of notes from a key, one at a time, in certain orders
* Chords are playing certain notes of a key, multiple at a time

*equal temperament

Music theory

Melod

the vibes guy for learning scales

scale degrees
nns - roman numerals 145 maj, 236 min, 7 dim
triads and inversions
- "skip one"
tetrads and inversions
tensions vs. add 2/suspended
"diatonic"
pentatonic/blues scale

key = collection of notes
scale = specific ordering of those notes

modes and relative minor
ear training
- scale degrees chords

3 pillars of music theory
- technique pertains to instrument, other 2 are independent of instrument

guitar - ukulele/nylong strings
guitar is the easiest way to get started with music because the open chords let you do 90% of the job without any theory - piano requires voice leading

guitar - find YT video showing hand placement for chords (or Justinguitar)
- find video where someone explains hand/wrist positioning for chords

music theory is a set of rules created to describe music and what sounds good
define keys, chords, scales, notes, halftones, whole tones, make sure they can count the white notes and label SDs, knowing names of white notes

key idea: triad "every other" pattern starting on each root

ukulele might be easier if fingers having a hard time

melody interacts with harmony by melody settling into (or not) the chord tones
